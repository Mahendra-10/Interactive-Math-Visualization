-- DESIGN -- 

We designed our project to handle a certain file step by step. This approach makes it easier for us to structure and organize everything. 
We began by working on the "expr" file, which allowed us to create a tree. Then, we worked on the parser to parse the function equations. 
Next, we created fields and methods for plot, so that all the input could be located in their respective places. After that, we worked on 
the "reader" file, which extracts information such as "Plot", "Color", "Functions", and "Fills" from the file. Once we successfully read 
and extracted all the necessary information, we moved on to the renderer to output the image. From there, we worked on the image itself. 
Finally, we cleaned up the code and added any other necessary functions.

-- COMPLETENESS -- 

The project does not have any missing/incorrect functionalities. It is 100% complete and passes all autograder tests on Gradescope.
